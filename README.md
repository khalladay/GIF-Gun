# GIF-Gun
This is probably my favourite thing that I've ever built. 

This was mostly built to amuse myself, but also as a way to test out my gif reading lib [gif_read](https://github.com/khalladay/gif_read). This uses a collection of animated gifs as the texture source for decals. Click to spay a gif (of random size) onto a wall. WASD controls for the camera. 

The code is messy, and it doesn't do any intelligent instance management, so it'll run slower as you spray more gifs on the wall... I could fix it but I think it's funnier this way.
